            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Shillah Naigaga, a dedicated Software Engineering student with a deep passion for building
                robust and intuitive web experiences. My technical focus lies primarily in front-end development,
                where I enjoy merging creative design with clean, functional code. I am enthusiastic about the JavaScript
                ecosystem, specializing in React for creating modern, dynamic user interfaces. Beyond the client-side, I
                also pursue backend development, with strong interests in JavaScript (Node.js) and PHP. I thrive on
                transforming complex challenges into elegant solutions and am always eager to explore new technologies to
                enhance my development toolkit.
            </p>
